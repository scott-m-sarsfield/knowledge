### Tiny articles for things that came up during development

Frankly, most of the pages are just going to contain links to properly written articles that I have read / looked at that were helpful while learning a handful of topics.

I hope that I could theoretically look back on this if I ever forget how to set up a specific part of my environment...

Of course, the shifting sands of software development could mean that some of this could be irrelevant in a few years.

I could at some point turn my back on JavaScript and never look back.  Alas, I'm doing quite well with it at the moment.
