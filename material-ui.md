##### Thoughts
- One of the slightly annoying things about this library is that the components require a `<MuiThemeProvider />` component wrapping the application (more or less).  It's one of those things that I tend to overlook when setting up to use material-ui for the first time.  Meanwhile, I suppose that I throw so much custom CSS / style objects into components that global / context-driven themes sound fairly unappealing.
