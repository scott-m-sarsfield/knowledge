# Technology I have yet to embrace

For better or worse, I haven't gotten on board with the following.

- `await / aysnc`
    - I perfectly happy with promises at the moment.  Meanwhile, I don't feel like await & async has become standard practice yet.

- `immutableJS`
    - In the redux article on using ImmutableJS, it is advised to replace the whole tree with it.  
    > [https://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/UsingImmutableJS.html#make-your-entire-redux-state-tree-an-immutablejs-object](https://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/UsingImmutableJS.html#make-your-entire-redux-state-tree-an-immutablejs-object)

    Which means that I'd have the whole application dependent on the classes and subclasses of one library.  I feel like that's a hefty amount of coupling. (And it's another library on top of all the other stuff I've come to use.)

- Angular
    - I feel that React is ahead of the game here.  (There may be a bit of a "baby duck syndrome".)
